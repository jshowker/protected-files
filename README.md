# protected-files

What does the project:
The project is a graphical interface that allows users to manage files and folders. It includes adding files, creating folders, deleting items, generating encryption keys, and viewing encrypted files. Access to these features requires face recognition via a webcam.

Why the project is useful:
The project is useful for data security. It allows users to encrypt files and manage them in a user-friendly interface. The use of facial recognition adds an additional layer of protection, ensuring that only authorized users gain access to the programâ€™s features.

How users can get started with the project:
Set the necessary dependencies: Make sure you have the libraries tkinter, ttkbootstrap, Pillow, face_recognition, and opencv-python installed.
Start the program: Open the main program file and run it.
Allow camera access: Click "Unlock" to pass facial recognition.
Start using the interface: After a successful face check, a window will open with the option of adding files, creating folders and other file management features.
